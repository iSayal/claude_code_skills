# Assessment and Question Generation Techniques

## Bloom's Taxonomy for Question Classification

### Six Cognitive Levels
1. **Remember**: Recall facts and basic concepts
   - Keywords: list, define, identify, label
2. **Understand**: Explain ideas or concepts
   - Keywords: describe, explain, summarize, paraphrase
3. **Apply**: Use information in new situations
   - Keywords: demonstrate, solve, illustrate, apply
4. **Analyze**: Draw connections among ideas
   - Keywords: compare, contrast, categorize, deconstruct
5. **Evaluate**: Justify a stand or decision
   - Keywords: assess, evaluate, critique, justify
6. **Create**: Produce new or original work
   - Keywords: design, construct, develop, formulate

## MCQ Construction Best Practices

### Writing Effective Stems
- State the question in simple, clear language
- Include only essential information
- Avoid negative statements when possible
- Ensure the stem is grammatically consistent with answers

### Developing Answer Choices
- Create three plausible distractors and one correct answer
- Keep all options approximately the same length
- Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above" when possible
- Ensure answers are mutually exclusive
- Place correct answer randomly among positions

### Common MCQ Pitfalls to Avoid
- Using double negatives
- Including grammatical clues that reveal the answer
- Making the correct answer significantly longer than others
- Using absolute terms like "always," "never," "all"
- Providing clues in other questions

## Automated Question Generation Strategies

### Factual Questions
- Identify key terms, definitions, dates, and statistics
- Convert declarative sentences to interrogative form
- Focus on important concepts highlighted in text

### Conceptual Questions
- Identify cause-and-effect relationships
- Focus on definitions and explanations of processes
- Address comparisons and contrasts in the text

### Application Questions
- Look for examples and case studies in the text
- Identify principles that can be applied to new situations
- Focus on problem-solving approaches described in content

## Difficulty Calibration

### Basic Level Questions
- Focus on direct recall of information
- Use exact terminology from the text
- Test recognition of key terms and definitions

### Intermediate Level Questions
- Require understanding of relationships between concepts
- Combine multiple pieces of information from text
- Test application of concepts to slightly modified situations

### Advanced Level Questions
- Require synthesis of multiple concepts
- Test evaluation of ideas presented in text
- Challenge students to apply knowledge in novel contexts

## Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] Is the question based solely on information in the PDF?
- [ ] Are all answer choices grammatically consistent?
- [ ] Are distractors plausible but clearly incorrect?
- [ ] Is the correct answer position randomized?
- [ ] Does the question test understanding, not just memorization?
- [ ] Is the question clear and unambiguous?
- [ ] Does the difficulty level match the stated level?
