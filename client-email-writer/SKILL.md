# Client Email Writer

This skill helps write professional emails to clients with a soft, conversational tone that doesn't sound like AI-generated content. Emails should be to the point and precise, without repeating information provided by the client.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when drafting emails to:
- Acknowledge client requests or tasks
- Reply after completing tasks
- Request clarification when client information is incomplete or confusing
- Any client communication requiring a professional yet approachable tone

## Email Analysis Guidelines

Before writing the email, analyze the client's message for:
- Important context like job changes, company transitions, or personal updates
- Professional milestones or transitions that deserve acknowledgment
- Opportunities to show personal interest or well-wishes when appropriate
- Critical information that needs to be addressed
- Emotional tone of the client's message to match appropriately

## Email Structure

Follow this structure when writing client emails:

### 1. Greeting
- Start with a warm, professional greeting
- Use "Hi [Name]" for familiarity or "Hello [Name]" for more formality
- If name is unknown, use "Hello" or "Good day"
- Avoid always starting with "Thank you" - only use when appropriate
- Consider the context of the email and open accordingly
- For follow-ups, you can start directly with the subject matter

### 2. Main Content
- **For Acknowledgment**: Briefly acknowledge the task/request and provide timeline if applicable
- **For Completion**: Confirm the task is completed with minimal detail
- **For Clarification**: Ask specific questions about incomplete or confusing information
- **Precision**: Do not repeat information already provided by the client - focus only on your response/action
- **Clarity**: Use short sentences and paragraphs
- **Tone**: Maintain a helpful, supportive tone

### 3. Closing
- Offer assistance or next steps when relevant
- Express availability for follow-up if appropriate

### 4. Signature
- Professional closing: "Best regards," or "Warm regards,"
- Full name: Imran Ahmed
- Professional title: Salesforce Consultant

## Tone Guidelines

- **Concise**: Get to the point quickly
- **Conversational**: Write as if having a professional conversation
- **Clear**: Use simple, direct language
- **Warm**: Friendly but professional
- **Human**: Avoid robotic or AI-like phrasing
- **Respectful**: Show consideration for client's time and needs

## Language Patterns to Use

- "Thank you for reaching out about..."
- "I'll take care of this right away"
- "I've completed..."
- "I understand you need..."
- "I'll process this request and confirm once completed"
- "Please let me know if you have any questions"

## Language to Avoid

- Overly formal phrases like "I hope this email finds you in good health"
- Robotic phrases like "Please find attached for your review"
- AI-generated sounding phrases like "I wanted to circle back"
- Impersonal language
- Repetition of client's information
- Redundant explanations

## Signature Template

```
Best regards,

Imran Ahmed
Salesforce Consultant
```

## Examples

### Acknowledgment Email
"Hi Sarah,
Thank you for your request to update the user permissions. I'll work on this today and will confirm once completed.
Best regards,
Imran Ahmed
Salesforce Consultant"

### Completion Email
"Hi Sarah,
The user account has been successfully updated as requested.
Best regards,
Imran Ahmed

### Clarification Email
"Hi Sarah,
I need a bit more information to complete this request. Could you clarify which specific fields need to be modified?
Best regards,
Imran Ahmed
Salesforce Consultant"

Remember to keep emails concise and to the point, avoid repeating client information, and always include the proper signature at the end.
