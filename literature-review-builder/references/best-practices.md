# Literature Review Best Practices

## Core Principles

A literature review is not a list of summaries—it's a **synthesis** that tells the story of what research knows, doesn't know, and needs to know.

---

## 1. Start With Clear Scope

### Define Boundaries Early

| Define | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Timeframe | "Studies from 2020-2025" |
| Population | "Adult workers in corporate settings" |
| Geography | "Research conducted in North America and Europe" |
| Source types | "Peer-reviewed journals only" |
| Exclusions | "Excluding self-published blogs and opinion pieces" |

### Research Question Template

```
"What does the literature say about [specific topic]
for [specific population/context]
over [timeframe]?"
```

---

## 2. Select Quality Sources

### Source Hierarchy (Academic Context)

| Tier | Source Type | Use For |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | Peer-reviewed journals | Primary evidence, core findings |
| **Tier 2** | Academic books/chapters | Theoretical frameworks, comprehensive coverage |
| **Tier 3** | Reputable industry reports | Current practices, real-world applications |
| **Tier 4** | Conference proceedings | Cutting-edge, not yet published |
| **Avoid** | Blogs, popular media | Unless analyzing public discourse |

### Red Flags

- Single-author papers in predatory journals
- Studies without clear methodology
- Opinion pieces presented as research
- Sources >10 years old (unless historical analysis)

## 3. Synthesize, Don't Summarize

### The Difference

| Summarizing (Bad) | Synthesizing (Good) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Smith (2023) found X." | "Multiple studies (Smith 2023; Jones 2024) consistently show X, particularly when..." |
| List each source separately | Group sources by ideas/themes |
| No connections between sources | Show agreements, tensions, contradictions |
| Neutral description | Critical evaluation |

### Synthesis Techniques

**Group by Finding:**
```
Poor: Smith said X. Jones said Y. Lee said Z.
Better: Three perspectives emerge. Smith and Jones argue X,
while Lee challenges this with Z, suggesting...
```

**Highlight Tensions:**
```
"While Productivity Studies A, B, and C show remote work increases output,
Collaboration Research D, E, and F demonstrates reduced team innovation.
This tension suggests remote work benefits individuals but challenges teams."
```

**Methodological Awareness:**
```
"Studies using self-report surveys (X, Y, Z) consistently show higher satisfaction
than objective performance metrics (A, B, C), suggesting perception may not
match reality."
```

---

## 4. Organize Thematically

### Thematic Organization Pattern

```
❌ Source-by-Source:
- Study 1: Everything about it
- Study 2: Everything about it
- Study 3: Everything about it

✓ Thematic:
- Theme 1: How Studies 1, 2, and 3 address Concept A
- Theme 2: How Studies 2, 4, and 5 address Concept B
- Theme 3: How Studies 1, 3, and 5 address Concept C
```

### Identify Themes Through

1. **Recurring concepts** - What ideas appear repeatedly?
2. **Debates** - Where do sources disagree?
3. **Methodological clusters** - How was research conducted?
4. **Population differences** - Different groups studied?
5. **Temporal patterns** - How has thinking evolved?

---

## 5. Critical Evaluation

### Questions to Ask of Each Source

| Aspect | Ask |
|--------|-----|
| **Methodology** | Was the approach sound? Sample size adequate? |
| **Sample** | Representative? Biased? Applicable to context? |
| **Findings** | Supported by data? Overstated? |
| **Limitations** | What did authors acknowledge? What's missing? |
| **Context** | When/where conducted? Still applicable? |

### Signal Critical Thinking

```
"While Jones (2024) reports significant gains, the small sample size (n=23)
limits generalizability. Additionally, the study duration of only two weeks
may not capture long-term effects."
```

``"These findings should be interpreted cautiously, as all participants were
from tech companies, potentially limiting applicability to other sectors."
```

---

## 6. Identify the Research Gap

### What Is a Research Gap?

A research gap is **what's missing** from existing knowledge. It's the justification for new research.

### Types of Gaps

| Gap Type | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Knowledge gap** | "No studies have examined X in Y population" |
| **Methodological gap** | "All existing research uses quantitative methods; qualitative insights are missing" |
| **Contextual gap** | "Research conducted in US may not apply in Asian markets" |
| **Temporal gap** | "No studies since 2020, missing post-pandemic changes" |
| **Theoretical gap** | "Existing theory doesn't explain emerging phenomenon X" |

### Signal the Gap

```
"Despite extensive research on individual productivity, no studies have
examined how remote work affects team-level innovation over time."
```

``"The literature focuses exclusively on full-time employees, leaving
the experiences of gig economy workers unexplored."
```

---

## 7. Use Clear Signposting

### Transition Words

| Purpose | Phrases |
|---------|---------|
| **Adding** | "Additionally," "Furthermore," "Moreover," |
| **Contrasting** | "However," "In contrast," "Conversely," "Nevertheless," |
| **Concluding** | "Overall," "Taken together," "Synthesizing these findings," |
| **Synthesizing** | "While X suggests..., Y indicates..." |
| ** qualifying** | "With one exception..." "To some extent..." |

### Section Transitions

```
"Having examined individual productivity outcomes, we now turn to
team-level collaboration, where the literature reveals more
contradictory findings."
```

---

## 8. Balance Sources

### Representation Principles

- **Multiple perspectives**: Don't only include sources that agree
- **Recent emphasis**: Prioritize recent work (unless historical)
- **Methodological diversity**: Include different approaches when available
- **Geographic spread**: Note if studies are concentrated in one region

### Avoid Over-Reliance

❌ "According to Smith (2023)..." (mentioned 10+ times)
✓ "Multiple studies (Smith 2023; Jones 2024; Lee 2025) concur..."

---

## 9. Audience Awareness

### Adapt Technicality

| Audience | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Academic experts** | Technical language, detailed methodology, extensive critique |
| **Students** | Clear explanations, define terms, scaffold complexity |
| **Practitioners** | Practical implications, minimal jargon, actionable insights |
| **General public** | Simple language, relatable examples, broad themes |

### Signal Your Approach

```
"For the practitioner, these findings suggest..."
"From an academic perspective, the theoretical implications are..."
```

---

## 10. Length Guidelines

### By Word Count

| Length | Sections | Sources |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **1,000 words** | 2-3 themes | 8-12 sources |
| **2,000 words** | 4-5 themes | 15-25 sources |
| **3,000+ words** | 5-7 themes | 25-40+ sources |

### Section Distribution

| Section | Percentage |
|---------|------------|
| Introduction | 10-15% |
| Body (themes) | 70-80% |
| Conclusion | 10-15% |

---

## 11. Common Citation Patterns

### In-Text Citation Styles

```
One author: (Smith, 2024)
Two authors: (Smith & Jones, 2024)
Three+ authors: (Smith et al., 2024)

Multiple sources supporting same point:
(Smith, 2024; Jones, 2023; Lee, 2025)

Multiple sources by same author:
(Smith, 2023, 2024)

Direct quote:
"verbatim text" (Smith, 2024, p. 42)
```

### Integrating Citations

```
✓ "Recent research confirms this pattern (Jones, 2024; Lee, 2025)."
✓ "Williams (2024) argues that..."
✓ "This finding is consistent across multiple studies (Brown, 2023; Davis, 2024; Miller, 2025)."
```
